## Default Design

```code
└── Laravel
    ├── app
    ├── bootstrap
    ├── config
    ├── database
    ├── public
    ├── resources
    ├── routes
    ├── storage
    ├── tests
    └── vendor
```

The default Laravel directory structure is as follows:
   
   - `app`: Contains the core code of the application.
   - `bootstrap`: Contains the application bootstrapping scripts.
   - `config`: Contains configuration files.
   - `database`: Contains database-related files such as migrations and seeders.
   - `public`: Contains the front controller and assets.
   - `resources`: Contains views, assets, and language files.
   - `routes`: Contains route files.
   - `storage`: Contains logs, cache, and other storage files.
   - `tests`: Contains test files.
   - `vendor`: Contains Composer dependencies.

## Modular Design
        The modular design of Aaran BMS is based on the Laravel framework, 
        which is a popular PHP framework for building web applications.

```code
    └── aaran
        └── Blog
            ├── Database
            ├── Livewire
            ├── Models
            ├── Providers
            └── Tests
```


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The directory named `aaran` is the root of a nested directory structure.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure under `aaran` includes various subdirectories and files.

- `aaran`: Root directory of the BMS.
    - `Blog`: Subdirectory under `aaran` act as Modular Folder.
        - `Database`: Migrations, seeders, and factories related to the module.
        - `Livewire`: Livewire class component and Blade views.
        - `Models`: Eloquent models representing the data structures used by the module.
        - `providers`: Service providers for the module.
        - `Tests`: Unit and feature tests for the module.
      
    - Files under `aaran`.
        - `api`: API routes.
        - `Console`: Artisan commands.
        - `Config`: configuration files.
        - `routes`: Module-specific routes.
            
This structure is typically used in PHP projects to organize code and resources in a modular and maintainable way.

## Module Design in `AARAN-BMS`
---
 >>A module in **`AARAN-BMS`** is a self-contained unit of functionality that encapsulates specific features or components of the application.
   Each module is organized into a well-defined structure, consisting of directories and files that represent different parts of the module.

# Key Features of Modular Design
---
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Modules encapsulate specific functionality, promoting a clear separation between different parts of the application.
  - **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different projects, reducing duplication of effort and speeding up development.
  - **Maintainability**: Isolated modules make it easier to identify and fix bugs, and to implement new features without affecting unrelated parts of the application.
  - **Scalability**: Modular design supports scaling the application by enabling the addition of new modules without major changes to the existing codebase.
  - **Testability**: Modules can be tested independently, making it easier to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.
  - **Flexibility**: Modules can be added, removed, or modified without affecting other parts of the application, providing greater flexibility in development.
  - **Extensibility**: Modules can be extended or customized to meet specific requirements, allowing developers to tailor the application to their needs.
  - **Security**: Modular design can improve security by isolating sensitive code and data within specific modules, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
  - **Performance**: Modular design can improve performance by enabling the application to load only the modules that are needed, reducing resource consumption and speeding up response times.
  - **Collaboration**: Modular design can facilitate collaboration among developers by providing clear boundaries between different parts of the application, making it easier to work on different modules simultaneously.
  - **Documentation**: Modular design can improve documentation by organizing code and resources in a structured way, making it easier to understand and maintain the application over time.
  - **Versioning**: Modular design can support versioning by enabling developers to release updates to individual modules independently, ensuring that changes are backward-compatible and do not break existing functionality.
  - **Customization**: Modular design can support customization by allowing developers to modify or extend specific modules without affecting the rest of the application, providing greater flexibility in tailoring the application to specific requirements.
  - **Integration**: Modular design can support integration with third-party services or APIs by enabling developers to create modules that interact with external systems, making it easier to extend the functionality of the application.
  - **Deployment**: Modular design can improve deployment by enabling developers to deploy individual modules independently, reducing the risk of errors and downtime during the deployment process.
  - **Monitoring**: Modular design can improve monitoring by enabling developers to track the performance and usage of individual modules, making it easier to identify and fix issues as they arise.
